Simple discord bot that implements some features that I found useful:
* Edupage notificator
* Module to watch websites for updates
* Simple music bot implemeting queue
* A command to generate messages similar to those of my classmate using Markov chains (TODO: scrape and generate messages from any user's messages)
* Also some stuff to abuse having administrator permissions :D
